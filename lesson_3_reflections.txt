When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    
    it would be more convenient to have a remote repository, because sometimes when I travel, I don't get access to my local computer, but I want to make some changes. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    sometimes you don't want to share some of your files public, maybe they are not correct or finished.
